###Overall:

1. Folder Structure (./src/...):

- api: where we create axios client and apis.
- assets: contains logo and a "noChat" component.
- components: contains several dumb components.
- config: saves common setting of this webapp including DEFAULT_PATH, LANGS...
- data: development data (fake chat_list, fake messages...) and defined icon objects
- hooks: custom and define personal-using hooks
- models: defines type of data.
- layouts: defines auth/dashboard layout of this application.
- model: define TypeScript types (I don't have too much time, so "any" perhaps is a good choice :( )
- pages: contains pages of this webapp including: 404 not-found page, auth, main messenger and setting page.
- providers: theme-setting, setting-app providers.
- routes: seperate auth/dashboard route.
- sections: form structures, message types (incoming, outgoing,...)
- store: where we initialize reducer store and root saga
- theme: provides theme, color for a whole of app (idea from a MUI template).
- utils: store a couple of small functions like: authHandler, getLocation...

##### socket.ts: initialize socket-client

2. Concepts of this chatapp:

![alt text](./public/images//UI_overall.jpg "Overall of webapp")

#### a) API: http requests

- A page in src/pages: dispatch a action by useAppSelector (e.g: getUserInfo) 

- Store (src/pages: something.slice.ts): is dispatched

- Middlewares: redux-saga (src/pages/ something.saga.ts)
    + a saga calls api from src/api folder
    + changes state in the store

- View (src/pages Something.tsx): receives "state" by using useAppSelector

#### b) Socket:

- In src/layouts:
+ connect socket
+ on/wait data from server emits (e.g: new messages)

- A page in src/pages 
+ emit info (e.g: user ID to get back a list of messages related to that user or 'end' to singout)

#### c) Features:
- Sign in/ resgister/ reset password/ verify OTP

- Get location of user and emit to server.
- Notify the rest of server when a user logged in or it is the first time join in.
- Chat 1v1 (of course)

#### d) Unfinnished features:

- Calling
- Send: files, images...
- Settings profile
